# MBA Data Engineering Portfolio

This is a personal repository for the Data Engineering MBA program. This repo collects all of my coursework, assignments, and exercises organized by discipline.

## Repository Structure

Each discipline in the MBA has its own top-level folder. Inside each discipline folder, you will find:

```text
├── Discipline-1/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── assignments/
│   ├── exercises/
│   └── resources/
├── Discipline-2/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── assignments/
│   ├── exercises/
│   └── resources/
└── README.md
```

- **README.md** – an overview of the discipline’s topics, assignments, and exercises.
- **assignments/** – completed projects and exercises.
- **exercises/** – smaller practice tasks, scripts, notebooks, etc.
- **resources/** (optional) – reference materials, lecture slides, data samples, etc.


## How to Use

1. **Browse by discipline**  
   Navigate into any discipline folder to see its README, which explains the content and structure for that subject.

2. **Review assignments**  
   The `assignments/` subfolder contains full projects, reports, or notebooks submitted for grading.

3. **Practice with exercises**  
   The `exercises/` subfolder holds smaller practice tasks designed to reinforce key concepts and techniques.

4. **Explore additional resources**  
   If included, the `resources/` folder has lecture slides, datasets, or helpful links.
